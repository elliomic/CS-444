\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}

\par The main point of this assignment was to look into how memory management and system calls work.

\item \textbf{How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc}

\par We wanted to figure out the best fit for the system calls. Therefore, we first figured them out and then found the best fit.

\item \textbf{How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.}

\par If the vm booted up, we knew that we had the right solution. If it didn't, then it was wrong,

\item \textbf{What did you learn?}

\par We learned about memory management and system calls.
